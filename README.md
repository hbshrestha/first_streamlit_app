# first_streamlit_app

First streamlit app inspired by [Coding is Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0A9i6d320&ab_channel=CodingIsFun)

## To run the app from the terminal
`streamlit run myfirst_streamlit_app.py`

## To quit the app
Press `Ctrl+C`

## To deploy on the web
Go to https://share.streamlit.io/ It is quite straight forward. The instructions can be found [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started).

### Note
The required packages need to be mentioned in `requirements.txt` file. I encountered an error while deploying the app via share.streamlit.io until I included `openpyxl` package in the `requirements.txt` file.
